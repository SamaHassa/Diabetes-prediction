🏥 Diabetes Prediction - Machine Learning Project

📌 Project Overview

This project is a full data science pipeline for predicting diabetes using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready code.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation 📊

Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization 🎨

Scikit-Learn for machine learning models 🤖

Jupyter Notebook for development 📓

📊 Machine Learning Models Used

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

🚀 Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Run the notebook Diabetes predicting full data science project.ipynb to execute the project pipeline.

📈 Results

The models are evaluated based on precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

Recall is prioritized, as missing a diabetes case can be dangerous.
